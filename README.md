# MACHINES

Deterministic Nix configuration for all of [my](https://coredump.blog) machines.
Linux machines run [NixOS](https://nixos.org) and macOS machines
use [nix-darwin](https://github.com/nix-darwin/nix-darwin).
Both machines use [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager)
for the bulk of their configuration.
